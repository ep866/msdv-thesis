###Capitalism's toxic assumptions
#####Poole, E. (2015). Capitalism's toxic assumptions. London: Bloomsbury.

-

*Capitalism's toxic assumptions* is looking at the capitalist model from the standpoint of  seven assumptions it is making, namely, the assumptions of competition, the ‘invisible hand’, utility, agency theory, that market pricing is right, the supremacy of the shareholder, and legitimacy of the limited liability model. It argues that economists refuse to update their worldview and that they still see the market as guided by laws of nature rather than as compiling scientific evidence suggest – an ever changing organism. Poole argues that the system as a whole is at risk as the seven big ideas/assumptions are no longer serving the model and has become cancerous. 

The book can help me understand better the tensions that we observe in society and are obstacles to happiness and equality. It will help me understand the ever growing gap in economic development and the disappearance of the middle class which creates obstacles to national and personal health and happiness. It can help me answer why society struggles with reaching equilibrium despite growing technological, healthcare, and information advances in the knowledge economy.

###Happiness and goodness: philosophical reflections on living well 
#####Cahn, Steven M. Happiness and goodness: philosophical reflections on living well. New York: Columbia University Press, 2015.

-

Happiness is a fundamental driving factor for the decisions we make and the ways in which we steer our lives. *Happiness and goodness* argues that happiness and our well-being are dependent on finding personal satisfaction rather than on activities we partake in, accomplishments or awards. They survey morality and happiness through looking at different perspectives derived from both history and religion while suggesting that moral behavior is neither necessary for nor ensuring happiness. 

Because the book looks at different perspectives from literature, history, and theology I hope it can help me answer the following questions: What are the main driving factors of happiness? What is the difference between what we think will make us happy vs what actually makes us happy? What role does morality play in our daily lives? Why do we choose abiding by morality as opposed to a hedonistic lifestyle in the pursuit of happiness?

###The brain and the meaning of life
#####Thagard, P. (2010). The brain and the meaning of life. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press.

-

Thagard argues that 'brain science matters for the most fundamental philosophical issues about knowledge, reality, morality and the meaning of life.' He defines a framework called neural naturalism that postulates that the best way to address philosophical questions is through science rather than by seeking supernatural forces and explanations. He moves through a series of questions ranging from the existence of free will to moral objectivity.

I am hoping this book will help me look at the question of happiness and morality through the prism of physiology and how the brain processes information. It will answer questions such as what does the brain call reality?  What drives ethics and morality if not a God? How do we make decisions?

###Tracking the meaning of life
#####Lurie, Y. (2006). Tracking the meaning of life. Columbia, Mo.: University of Missouri Press.

-

Lurie surveys different philosophical ideas on the question of the meaning of life. The four main arguments come from Lev Tolstoy, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus. The author wrote the book motivated by his own attempts to formulate an answer. 

This book will help me understand how an individual – Lurie went about researching this rather mysterious and difficult subject matter. From my brief time with it, I take it as a case study rooted in philosophy, an inspiration, rather than as a source of  actual answers.
